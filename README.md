# HiveMind

An AI developed to play the Hive board game.

## Components

There are 4 main components which make up the HiveMind AI. This repository contains the main AI logic.

* Client (**Swift**)
    * [hive-client](https://github.com/josephroquedev/hive-client)
    * iOS app to process state and display moves
    * Lightweight -- primarily encodes basic state and movements
    * GUI to display movements

* Server (**Ruby on Rails**)
    * [hive-server](https://github.com/josephroquedev/hive-server)
    * Lightweight
    * Receives the game state from the client and forwards it to the engine
    * Passes the suggested move from the engine back to the client

* Engine (**Swift**)
    * [hive-engine](https://github.com/josephroquedev/hive-engine)
    * Maintains the state of a game
    * Encodable & decodable to pass from client to server and back
    * Provides rules of the games to the AI to allow it to determine valid, playable moves

* HiveMind (**Swift**)
    * Given a game state, explores various moves to determine best play
    * Relies on alpha-beta pruning

## Getting Started

1. First, you'll need to grab a couple other repos to build the entire system and play a game of Hive against the HiveMind.
    * [Hive Client](https://github.com/josephroquedev/hive-client)
    * [Hive Server](https://github.com/josephroquedev/hive-server)
    * [HiveMind](https://github.com/josephroquedev/hivemind)
2. Run the following command to build a debug or release version, respectively:
    * `swift build -Xswiftc "-target" -Xswiftc "x86_64-apple-macosx10.13"`
    * `swift build -c release -Xswiftc "-target" -Xswiftc "x86_64-apple-macosx10.13"`
3. Begin an instance with `.build/debug/HiveMind` or `build/release/HiveMind`

### Requirements

* Swift 4.2+
* macOS 10.13+
